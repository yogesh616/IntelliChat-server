in this company i can refine my skills and improve myself and can get a good opportunity in programming field.

4. What type of role are you looking for?
i've worked on several projects where i use react js + tailwind css + nodejs + express also mongoose for handeling data and microservices and node cache for in memory caching ( but only for small json data structure ) 
so i can handle a full stack project.

5. What are your strengths and weaknesses?
everyone im trying to improve myself learning new skills, practicing javascript problems , and challenging myself for real world programming related problems. 



Frontend-Specific Questions:

1. Explain the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript.

var is global and function scoped variable keyword. with var we can redeclare and reassign variables. 
let and const are introduced in esmascript. with let we can reinitialize varibales but cannot redeclare. if we will do it we will got reference error. 
and we use const for those values which are remain constant like pi base_url , post numbers. with const cannnot redeclare niether reassign values , we will got assignment to constant variable error.

2. What are closures in JavaScript? Can you give an example?

closures are functions which will remember outer scope variables even after their execution.
we use closures for data encapsulation , making private variables
 example - 
    function foo() {
        let balance = 0;
        function increment(value) {
            return balance + value
        }
        return increment
    }

3. How does the virtual DOM work in React?

react uses virtual dom which is a light weight copy of actual dom. react uses diffing algorithm called react fiber. with it react check state modifications and updation. if it find difference between actual dom and virtual dom it will update state instead of rerendering whole dom tree.

4. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
== & === both of are comparing operators. == is called loosly comparative operator because it will only compare values. if we compare '5' and 5 with == we will get true because it just checked their values. but === called strictly comparative operator which check values with their data types, which will return false first one is string and second in number

5. Can you explain the concept of responsive web design?
responsive web design is a very crucial concept for web application. bacause in app development or desktop development we will create applications for specific screen size. but in web development we have to create application for different screen sizes. we use rem, media queries, flex , grid properties to do that.

6. What are React hooks? Can you explain useState and useEffect with examples?

react hooks are replacable methods of class components. we use hooks in functional components. with hooks we can easily and in less code can modify state and ui. useState and useEffect are mostly used hooks in react. we use usestate for state modifition. where we have a variable and their updator function. and with useeffect we works wwith component lifecycle methods. useeffect handles componentdidmount method when it called with empty dependency array, handle componentwillupdate when we use a state variable or function in dependency array and handles componentwillunmount when we return a cleanup function

const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(( => {
        setCount(count++)
    }))
    return => clearInterval(intervalId)
}, [count])

7. What is the purpose of keys in React lists? Why is it important?
keys are very important when we are rendering array or object data. keys handles that we are not using same data. for example if we handling api which will return an array and we have to render it in ui. we can do but we have to add a function which will handle data related to array related id so we have to key . generally we pass index in key

example- {data.length > 0 data.map((index, value) => (
    <div key={index}>
     <li onClick={() => handleData(value.url)}>{value.name}</li>
    </div>)) : (<div>No data available <button onClick={fetchData}>Refresh </button> </div>)}

8. How do you optimize performance in a React application?

for performance optimization in react we can use useMemo and useCallback hooks for heavy operation and nerver changing values. we can use lazy loading for images , code splitting. personally i use localstorage for data will not change but we have to work with in frequently. i use utility functions to handle api requests related functions.


Backend-Specific Questions:

1. What is REST, and how do you handle it in an Express application?

rest stands for representations state tranfer, which is a architectural style for designing network application. with rest api we generally do crud operations like create, read update and delete . for building ideas restfulapi we use post request method for creation, get for reading data, put for updating data and delete for deleting data entries.
i will give you express js example of handling requests.

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
    res.json({data})
})

app.post('api/create', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { email, password} = req.body;
    if (email && password) {
        const newData = await CreateUser(email, password)
        res.json({newData})
    }
    }
    catch (e) {
        return throw new Error(e)
    }
})


2. How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations? Can you explain the event loop?
  i dont know much about it but node uses event driven architecture and callbacks for running javascript. 

  3. Explain middleware in Express and how it's used.

  in Express middleware are functions which execute requests 
  like we have to check is user is authenticated or not we create a middleware which check that  their cookies have authentication related data or not if not authenticated it will redirect to login page or cannot access data. we use next keyword in middleware

  4. How do you handle authentication and authorization in a web application?

  for authentication i use bcypt for hashing password, jsonwebtoken , cookie parser and mongoose for saving users data.
  and for authorization i use express middleware which will check is this user admin or not to do only admin related task.

  5. What are the different HTTP methods, and when would you use them (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)?
    i dont know much about it but i just worked with it. in get requests we can get data through query, params and post, put and delete have same concepts but works are different. post generally use for handling data related requests, put for updating and delete for deleting data entires.

 6. What is CORS, and how do you handle it in your application?
 cors stands for cross origin resource sharing. by default browser doesn't allow requests from everywhere. it will give cors error. so fix it in development phase i just use * in cors origin and in production i use client side url in cors origin so only that perticular url are allow to handling data.

 7. Can you explain the role of MongoDB and how you use Mongoose for database interaction in your project?
 mongodb is a database for storing data in bson (similar to json) format. where we have to define a schema to handle data. mongoose is a orm odm library which will easy their task work with mongodb. 

 General Problem-Solving Questions:

1. How would you reverse a linked list?
   i dont even know what is linked list.

2. Can you implement a function to check if a string is a palindrome?

function CheckPalindrome(str) {
    const normalValue = str.toLowerCase();
    const normalizedValue = normalValue.split('').reverse().join('')
    return normalValue === normalizedValue
}
console.log(CheckPalimdrome('hello')) // output - false

3. Explain the concept of closures with a real-world analogy.

with closures we can access outer function scope variables even after their execution. it used to create private variables. for real world analogy. assume we have to create a atm type application where user cannot see their balance but if they credit or debate balance from it now they can see their current balance. with closures we can do that easily.

4. Write a function to find the largest element in an array.

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'guava'];
function FindLargestElement(fruits) {
    const sortedArray = fruits.sort((a, b) => a.length - b.length);
    return sortedArray[sortedArray.length - 1]
} 

5. Explain how you would solve the "Two Sum" problem.

 i dont know.

 6. How would you handle error handling in your code?

 in my projects i use try catch for error handeling also console for seeing what type of error i'm facing.
 if i didn't got data from api i simply return an empty array or null and giving a alert ' there is  issue in fetchin data'



 Behavioral Questions:

1. Tell us about a challenging situation in one of your projects and how you handled it.

in a project i have to scrap data from different sites but if i do it in express request route code become messy . so i use express router for handling routes in separate file and also created a utility functions file where i written scraping related logic. with it my code became modular, readable and easy to understand.

2. How do you stay updated with the latest web development trends and technologies?
for staying updated i use youtube and google for getting technologies related latest news. i followed some programming related content creators on instagram, twitter and threads. and i also check libraries new versions

3. Have you ever worked in a team setting? How did you collaborate with team members?
 i didn't worked with team yet.


4. Tell us about a time you learned something new on your own. How did you approach it?
in a project i have to scrap different sites for scraping news related data. most sites are static so i can easily scrap data from these with cheerio. but i faced probelms when dealing with dynamic sites. so i google it, i found puppeteer which is good for handeling dynamic sites scraping. and now my project is working fine.
